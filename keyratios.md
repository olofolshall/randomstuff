### 1. **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**

- **Formula**: ROIC = NOPAT / Average Invested Capital
- **Components**:
  - **NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax)**: EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)
  - **Average Invested Capital**: Total Debt + Total Equity (or Fixed Assets + Net Working Capital)
- **Example**:
  - EBIT = $10,000,000
  - Tax Rate = 30%
  - Fixed Assets = $25,000,000
  - Net Working Capital = $5,000,000
  - NOPAT = $10,000,000 × (1 - 0.30) = $7,000,000
  - Invested Capital = $25,000,000 + $5,000,000 = $30,000,000
  - ROIC = $7,000,000 / $30,000,000 = 0.2333 or 23.33%

### 2. **Return on Equity (ROE)**

- **Formula**: ROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders’ Equity
- **Components**:
  - **Net Income**: Total Revenue - Total Expenses
  - **Average Shareholders’ Equity**: (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2
- **Example**:
  - Net Income = $10,000,000
  - Beginning Equity = $15,000,000
  - Ending Equity = $20,000,000
  - Average Shareholders’ Equity = ($15,000,000 + $20,000,000) / 2 = $17,500,000
  - ROE = $10,000,000 / $17,500,000 = 0.5714 or 57.14%

### 3. **Price to Earnings (P/E)**

- **Formula**: P/E = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)
- **Components**:
  - **Market Price per Share**: Current stock price
  - **Earnings per Share (EPS)**: Net Income / Total Number of Outstanding Shares
- **Example**:
  - Market Price per Share = $50
  - Net Income = $10,000,000
  - Total Number of Outstanding Shares = 1,000,000
  - EPS = $10,000,000 / 1,000,000 = $10
  - P/E = $50 / $10 = 5

### 4. **Enterprise Value to EBIT (EV/EBIT)**

- **Formula**: EV/EBIT = Enterprise Value / EBIT
- **Components**:
  - **Enterprise Value**: Market Capitalization + Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents
  - **EBIT**: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
- **Example**:
  - Market Capitalization = $100,000,000
  - Total Debt = $20,000,000
  - Cash and Cash Equivalents = $10,000,000
  - EBIT = $15,000,000
  - Enterprise Value = $100,000,000 + $20,000,000 - $10,000,000 = $110,000,000
  - EV/EBIT = $110,000,000 / $15,000,000 = 7.33

### 5. **Debt to Equity (D/E)**

- **Formula**: D/E = Total Debt / Total Shareholders’ Equity
- **Components**:
  - **Total Debt**: Short-term Debt + Long-term Debt
  - **Total Shareholders’ Equity**: Total Assets - Total Liabilities
- **Example**:
  - Total Debt = $20,000,000
  - Total Shareholders’ Equity = $50,000,000
  - D/E = $20,000,000 / $50,000,000 = 0.4 or 40%
**Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)** is a financial ratio used to measure a company's profitability and efficiency in using its capital. Here’s a detailed explanation of how to calculate ROCE:

### 6. **ROCE Formula**:
$$ \text{ROCE} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Capital Employed}} $$

### **Components**:
- **EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)**: This is the company's operating income, which is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold and operating expenses from revenues.
- **Capital Employed**: This can be calculated in two ways:
  1. **Total Assets - Current Liabilities**: This method subtracts current liabilities from total assets to find the capital employed.
  2. **Equity + Non-current Liabilities**: Alternatively, capital employed can be calculated by adding shareholder’s equity and total debt (including both short-term and long-term debts).

### **Example Calculation**:
- **EBIT**: $10,000,000
- **Total Assets**: $150,000,000
- **Current Liabilities**: $90,000,000
- **Capital Employed**: $150,000,000 - $90,000,000 = $60,000,000
- **ROCE**: $10,000,000 / $60,000,000 = 0.1667 or 16.67%

### **Interpretation**:
- **Higher ROCE**: Indicates more effective use of capital and better profitability.
- **Lower ROCE**: May suggest poor company management or a less profitable business.

ROCE is particularly useful for comparing companies within the same industry, especially in capital-intensive sectors such as telecom, oil & gas, and manufacturing. It provides a clear picture of how efficiently a company generates profits from its capital. However, it has limitations, such as not considering risk factors and focusing on short-term achievements.

These calculations provide a comprehensive understanding of a company’s financial performance and position.
