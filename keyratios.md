### 1. **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**

- **Formula**: ROIC = NOPAT / Average Invested Capital
- **Components**:
  - **NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax)**: EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)
  - **Average Invested Capital**: Total Debt + Total Equity (or Fixed Assets + Net Working Capital)
- **Example**:
  - EBIT = $10,000,000
  - Tax Rate = 30%
  - Fixed Assets = $25,000,000
  - Net Working Capital = $5,000,000
  - NOPAT = $10,000,000 × (1 - 0.30) = $7,000,000
  - Invested Capital = $25,000,000 + $5,000,000 = $30,000,000
  - ROIC = $7,000,000 / $30,000,000 = 0.2333 or 23.33%

### 2. **Return on Equity (ROE)**

- **Formula**: ROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders’ Equity
- **Components**:
  - **Net Income**: Total Revenue - Total Expenses
  - **Average Shareholders’ Equity**: (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2
- **Example**:
  - Net Income = $10,000,000
  - Beginning Equity = $15,000,000
  - Ending Equity = $20,000,000
  - Average Shareholders’ Equity = ($15,000,000 + $20,000,000) / 2 = $17,500,000
  - ROE = $10,000,000 / $17,500,000 = 0.5714 or 57.14%

### 3. **Price to Earnings (P/E)**

- **Formula**: P/E = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)
- **Components**:
  - **Market Price per Share**: Current stock price
  - **Earnings per Share (EPS)**: Net Income / Total Number of Outstanding Shares
- **Example**:
  - Market Price per Share = $50
  - Net Income = $10,000,000
  - Total Number of Outstanding Shares = 1,000,000
  - EPS = $10,000,000 / 1,000,000 = $10
  - P/E = $50 / $10 = 5

### 4. **Enterprise Value to EBIT (EV/EBIT)**

- **Formula**: EV/EBIT = Enterprise Value / EBIT
- **Components**:
  - **Enterprise Value**: Market Capitalization + Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents
  - **EBIT**: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
- **Example**:
  - Market Capitalization = $100,000,000
  - Total Debt = $20,000,000
  - Cash and Cash Equivalents = $10,000,000
  - EBIT = $15,000,000
  - Enterprise Value = $100,000,000 + $20,000,000 - $10,000,000 = $110,000,000
  - EV/EBIT = $110,000,000 / $15,000,000 = 7.33

### 5. **Debt to Equity (D/E)**

- **Formula**: D/E = Total Debt / Total Shareholders’ Equity
- **Components**:
  - **Total Debt**: Short-term Debt + Long-term Debt
  - **Total Shareholders’ Equity**: Total Assets - Total Liabilities
- **Example**:
  - Total Debt = $20,000,000
  - Total Shareholders’ Equity = $50,000,000
  - D/E = $20,000,000 / $50,000,000 = 0.4 or 40%

These calculations provide a comprehensive understanding of a company’s financial performance and position.
